		<h2>On premise Web-Server</h2>
		<p>Until recently my website was hosted on site with this little stand alone web-server.
		 <img alt="" src="images/emb_ethernet.jpg" width="224" height="212" />
 		It's based on a Pic18F series
		MCU and the RTL 8019AS MAC.
		For an 8 bit MCU this little thing 	served up the web pages surprisingly fast.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Of course it&#39;s not really meant as a personal web sever since it&#39;s 
		file system is on a 64K serial flash chip. This becomes pretty limiting 
		as you might guess. Maybe I work on interfacing a SD flash card to it to 
		expand the capacity. </p>
		<p>The real use of this device lies in remote monitoring of facilities 
		such as swimming pools, small&nbsp; businesses,&nbsp; factories, etc.&nbsp; 
		where it is important or nice to know when something is not working as 
		it should. </p>
		<p>So, for example as in the case of a bakery owner it&#39;s good to get an 
		early e-mail notification on the mobile phone when the walk in freezer 
		is loosing it&#39;s temper because the AC unit gave out,&nbsp; before all 
		the wedding cakes melt.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Or in the case of a pool manager it&#39;s helpful if the PH, Chlorine and 
		temperature values can be monitored and adjusted via the web while on 
		vacation in Tahiti. </p>
