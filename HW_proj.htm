		<h4>Some projects I have been working on in the past.</h4>
		<h5>PRISM </h5>
		<hr/>
		<p >
		A DSP based analog stimulus and measurement instrument used in In-Circuit 
		test equipment. It features dual analog stimulus of 
		<img src="images/PRISM_bd.jpg" style=" margin-left: 14px; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;" height="180" class="pic_style1"  />
		programmable frequency voltage and current. It's measurement 
		capability reach down into the pico amps and nano volt ranges. 
		As one can imagine this can be tricky when operating near 
		&quot;magnetically&quot; active devices such as transformers&nbsp; and solenoids.</p>
		<p style="text-align: left">
		To fully exploit the potential of the device careful attention had to be 
		given to any and all potential sources of noise in it&#39;s vicinity. It was 
		therefore not surprising that a large effort was spent on eradicating 
		such gremlins, either by re-designing&nbsp;or relocating sub-systems to 
		reduce the&nbsp;EMF smog&nbsp; in it&#39;s environment.</p>
		<p>
		On the hardware side I was responsible for the logic around 
		the DSP, the communication interface to the PC and the memory 
		arbitration between DSP and ADC, DAC and PC DMA, mainly the stuff that 
		went into the three big Altera chips on the bottom of the picture.</p>
		<p>
		On the Software side I was responsible for all of the DSP code as well 
		as the PC side that communicated with it. Click here to lock at 
		<a href="Samples%20of%20work/Altera%20AHDL%20projects.zip">example code</a> or take a look at the 
		<a href="Samples%20of%20work/Altera%20AHDL%20projects.zip">Hardware description langue</a> used. 
		
 </p>
		<h5>
		PCIO</h5> <hr/>
		<p>
		This board is the communication interface between the PC and the rest of 
		the test and measurement system. It&#39;s a PCI based adapter that had to be 
		compatible with a former ISA bus implementation, as well as with 
		multiple target devices in addition to also provide improved throughput 
		and reduced susceptibility to interference.
		 The 
		interface basically extends a local bus from the PCI to the 
		instrumentation by providing an mapping of a&nbsp; 4K window into the target 
		device&#39;s address space.&nbsp; 
		</p>
		<p>
		<img alt="" src="images/PCIO_card.jpg" width="239" height="155" style="margin-left: 19px" />
		I got stated on this board as a side project with the help of the HW 
		engineering manager who insisted that I was a honorary HW engineer in 
		spite my &quot;software&quot; job title. While he did all the hard stuff around 
		the line terminations, cross talk, reflections and EMI I was doing all 
		the fun parts with the digital design and schematic capture etc...&nbsp; 
		The logic was done in AHDL and I simulated the design&nbsp; while the board was in layout 
		and fab. This paid out in that the board had not a single HW ECO&#39;s and only 
		some minor 
		changes to the AHDL programming where necessary in the areas that could not 
		be simulated beforehand. 
		
 </p>
		<h5>DFPIO</h5><hr/>
		<p> 
		<img alt="" src="images/DFPIO.jpg" style="height: 145px; width: 250px"  />
		This is an other PCI based communication and control adapter used in 
		test and measurement systems. It is used to drive pin electrics so that 
		the address and data bus of the PC can be used to communicate and 
		simulate peripherals and CPUs in a testing environment The&nbsp; card 
		also features a JTAG engine for communication&nbsp; via Boundary Scan 
		and to program FLASH device in situ.</p>

		<h5>Lightning, Drag Race Starting Line Controller </h5>
		<hr/>
		<p>This device is used in 1/4 mile drag racing and provides the racer 
		with an accurate timing device to get the car rolling at exact the right 
		time. It hooks up to a trigger switch that the racer operates and 
		controls the cars throttle and brake. The aim is to get the car rolling 
		at EXACTLY the moment when the green light appears on the starting 
		light. To achieve this the racer triggers the device multiple times 
		during the starting sequence when the pre starting lights count down to 
		the green. Since the timing of the starting light count down is know the 
		human reaction and the vehicles inertia factor can be removed by 
		subtracting a know reaction time for the particular racer and vehicle 
		involved. </p>
		<p>This device is using an 8051 type of MCU and the programming is done 
		exclusively in assembler. &nbsp;I did extensive rework on the SW of this 
		device including redoing the user interface (keypad and LCD) as well a 
		adding features and removing bugs.&nbsp; Later I worked on the HW design 
		of a new version of the product where I got t do the schematic, Spice sim and layout of the board.&nbsp; 
		I hear the new design sold very well !</p>
